title: 2K Stages
---
<p>
	This is a fan site that aims to provide a potted historical summary of the content of the galaxy's greatest comic: the British weekly science fiction and fantasy anthology <strong class="noEmph">2000 AD</strong>, and its various spin-off publications.
</p>
<p>
	This ongoing project aims to eventually cover all stages from 1977 to the present. It also exists in a more interactive format as <a href="https://forums.2000ad.com/index.php?topic=45960.0" target="_blank">a thread on the 2000 AD Forum</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	2000 AD is owned by Rebellion and available (as current issues, back issues, subscriptions & TPBs, in either hard-copy or digital formats) from their <a href="https://shop.2000ad.com/" target="_blank">online shop</a>.
