In early 1992 (as prog 780 launched the much-hyped <a href="../progs/stage24.html">Megablast</a> jump-on) the Megazine re-launched as the fortnightly Volume 2 and a few weeks later we got the first direct crossover-thrill in the form of the Judge Dredd mega-epic Judgement Day (featuring special guest star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_the_Menace_and_Gnasher" target="_blank">Dennis the Menace</a>). That sort of sums up this era: on the one hand we get amazing new content (Devlin Waugh, Dredd teaming up with Alpha) and on the other there's a sort of childlike spattering of colorful paint across the walls of the living room while nobody's looking (in the form of a zombie-apocalypse-musical that leaves a bewildered Dredd looking on and trying to look taciturn).

<p><strong><a href="../../AtoZ/JudgeDredd/1992.html">Judge Dredd</a></strong><br />
The major event here is the mega-epic Judgement Day, running concurrently in the prog and the meg (the latter for each third episode), and so floating in at twenty episodes, four artists and 150 pages of <em>pressure to purchase both publications</em>. Ennis ladles it on by making it a globe-trotting, multi-Meg, multi-Judge-force adventure to save the planet from an unstoppable zombie horde consisting of <em>everyone who's ever died</em>. Mix in a pontificating stage villain (Sabbat the Necrophagus) who keeps Dennis the Menace [UK] as a pet and likes to put on musical stage shows for his captives, and you end up with an odd blend of deadly threat and camp spectacle.

<p>
Clearly in need of some grit, <a href="../../AtoZ/StrontiumDog/Flashbacks.html">Johnny Alpha</a> is teleported in from the future (inspired by 1990's <strong class="noEmph">Top Dogs</strong> story in the 1991 Judge Dredd Annual) as Dredd buys some time by nuking three of the world's Mega-Cities, at the loss of two billion lives. The climax is <em>Carry on Dirty Dozen</em> before Dredd and Alpha swagger off into the (apocalyptic, highly radioactive) sunset for all the world like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_Cogburn_(character)" target="_blank">Rooster Cogburn</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Custer" target="_blank">Jesse Custer</a>.

<p class="multFoot"><small><em>The prog and meg disentangle themselves, with the next crossover waiting until 1994...</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="../../AtoZ/DevlinWaugh/data.html">Devlin Waugh</a>: Swimming In Blood</strong> *NEW THRILL*<br />
One of the best character introductions of all time: this presents the titular toff as (in the author's words) "Noel Coward played by Arnold Schwarzenegger", a "spiritual envoy" working for the vatican in Dredd's world. We meet him as he is sent to Aquatraz (an underwater prison in the shape of a seahorse) to tackle a vampire incursion.
<br /><small><em>Our next meeting with Devlin is fleeting as we get a Brief Encounter in 2.26...</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="../../AtoZ/Armageddon/data.html">Armageddon</a>: The Bad Man</strong> *NEW THRILL*<br />
Borrowing heavily from Terminator, Total Recall (literally lifting the "Open your mind!" scene) and, uh, The Bible, this derivative slice of action pie enigmatically ends on a cliffhanger without fully explaining itself. There's a hint in Meg 1.19 that this is going to explain the origins of Mega-City One, but it never explicitly does that, instead telling us of a shadowy organization using global destablization as an excuse to grab power (while a psychic runs away from a mysterious assassin).
<br /><small><em>Tis one and done, as per the contractual shenanigans.</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="../../AtoZ/SoulSisters/data.html">Soul Sisters</a></strong> *NEW THRILL*<br />
An avant garde, campy, technicolor romp set sixty-two years beyond the Dredd timeline in Brit-Cit: the Soul Sisters are a pair of handy (in a fight) vigilante nuns. I can't tell you the plot beyond that because however many times I sit down to read it, I find myself losing the will to live and then my id autopilots me onto something less lethal. In the 1993 Judge Dredd Yearbook <strong>The Dark Nuns Return</strong> has the Sisters come back from the grave to help a Brit-Cit that has been plunged into hell by, erm, John Major.
<br /><small><em>And that's it for the Soul Sisters. You may thank God in His mercy (or the two Daves who stopped writing it). Or maybe you loved it, in which case I apologize.</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="../../AtoZ/AndersonPsiDivision/1992.html">Anderson Psi Division</a></strong><br />
The 1992 Judge Dredd Mega-Special features the tragic two-part <strong>Baby Talk</strong>, in which a narcotic ingested by a pregnant addict gives her embryo psi powers. Meg 2.08's <strong>Blythe Spirit</strong> sees an insanely tortured soul set loose on a packed block. It's notable for two things: Anderson is continually followed around by a wind machine (because it's David Roach on art) and the climactic line is "Kill the chicken!" <strong>George</strong> (in the 1993 Judge Dredd Yearbook) is a weak-sauce, one-note joke strip about a satanic tapeworm (called George).
<br /><small><em>Anderson continues into the next Meg stage...</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="../../AtoZ/JudgeHershey/CouncilOfFive.html">Judge Hershey</a>: Downtime</strong><br />
The second solo outing for Hershey (since 1989's Mega-Special) sees her dealing with a violent drug outbreak at her local gym. (Yes, there is exposition explaining why she's at a local gym as opposed to a Justice Department facility.)
<br /><small><em>Hershey has more tales in the next Meg stage...</em></small></p>

<h2>Special Mentions:</h2>

<p><strong><a href="../../AtoZ/RedRazors/data.html">Red Razors</a></strong><br />
The 1992 Judge Dredd Mega-Special regales us with <strong>The Secret Origin Of Comrade Ed</strong>, in which we discover that Ed got deliberately transformed from human to sentient horse in order to escape an ugly girlfriend with a psycophathic father. The 1993 Judge Dredd Yearbook has Razors take on a gang of homicidal medical men in the risible <strong>Doctor's Orders</strong>.
<br /><small><em>A second series of this ... <em>thing</em> ... transits from the Meg to the prog in 1994...</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="../../AtoZ/StraitjacketFits/data.html">The Straitjacket Fits</a>: The Final Fit - The Relapse</strong> <small>(1993 Judge Dredd Yearbook)</small><br />
A follow-up to the Megazine's <a href="../megs/meg1_0.html">Volume #1</a> comedy, this provides a self-referential, self-confessed lack of resolve whose most impressive moment is a riff on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_Asylum:_A_Serious_House_on_Serious_Earth" target="_blank">Arkham Asylum</a> (McKean & Morrison, 1989).
<br /><small><em>The sub-title speaketh true, and this is indeed the last of this.</em></small></p>
