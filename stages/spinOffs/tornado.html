<p><strong>Victor Drago</strong><br />
Presented as a mixture of text and strip stories (4 of the 6 are text), these are the investigations of Baker Street residing, pipe-smoking detective <strike>Sherlock Holmes</strike> <strike>Sexton Blake</strike> Victor Drago and his assistant <strike>Watson</strike> <strike>Tinker</strike> Spencer.</p>

<br /><small><em style="font-weight: 300;">Continues with the 2000 AD merger of prog 127.</small></em></p>

<p><strong>The Angry Planet</strong><br />

<p><strong>Captain Klep</strong><br />

<br /><small><em>Continues with the 2000 AD merger of prog 127.</small></em></p>

<p><strong>Storm</strong><br />
Feral teenager of the Scottish highlands (aren't they all?) meets a Henry Higgins type: it's Wee Geordie crossed with Pygmalion.  Beano/Viz style episodic calamity ensues.</p>

<p><strong>Black Hawk</strong><br />
It's Spartacus meets the Dirty Dozen as a nubian warrior leads a special Roman cohort accompanied by his familiar (and literal) black hawk [see title].
<br /><small><em>Continues with the 2000 AD merger of prog 127 and becomes something else altogether...</small></em></p>

<p><strong>[Big E]</strong><br />
The first two are "Big E Specials" and the final two are photo stories in which Dave Gibbons gamely abandons any pretense at ego by dressing up as the superheroic titular editor.</p>

<p><strong>The Lawless Touch</strong><br />
Johnny <strike>DiGriz</strike> Lawless is a thief turned secret agent who sometimes goes up against the <strike>Russians</strike> Volgans, making this a mash-up of the premise of The Stainless Steel Rat and the setting of Invasion.  (Set pre-Invasion, we can note the absence of any global flooding.)</p>

<p><strong>Tornado's Gallery of Heroes</strong><br />
A poster series by Carlos Ezquerra that provides everything from Roman Centurions to Mek Warriors: really a warriors through the ages (and beyond).</p>
