		<h2>Stage 32 - 3-Prog Mini-Series</h2>
<h3>Progs 901-903: 1994</h3>

<hr class="splitter" />

<p>
This was a second attempt at that idea from progs 850-851 to do a super-tight run of thrills: this time a three-parter. I guess the idea never took off, as it never happens again.

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/ktW-dcoj3y0" target="_blank">Judge Dredd</a></strong><br />
<strong>Judge Death: The True Story</strong> is a light, frothy two-parter with far too many gradient-fill backdrops in which Comedy Death briefly goes back in time to 20th century Bexhill. It sounds ripe, but is a damp squib and only manages to fill two of the three progs. The third prog gives us <strong>Part Exchange</strong>, where muggers and organ leggers have joined forces to optimize their business practices.

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/kjncq39dvIc" target="_blank">Durham Red</a>: Mirrors</strong><br />
Navel-gazing imagineering of what it means to be Durham Red, with a dream sequence that's not too far off the plot of 1998's <strong>The Scarlet Cantos</strong>. As with most dreams, ultimately nothing happens.
<br /><small><em>Durham has some one-offs in upcoming specials before another mini-series in '95, but this tells us to look out for her next in Strontium Dogs (also in '95)...</em></small></p>


<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Ry8KKQXkmb8" target="_blank">Rogue Trooper</a> [Fr1day Supper]: G.I. Blues</strong><br />
Retcon update: as with the return of the chips, now the Norts and Southers are suddenly back in the story, and Fr1day "knifes" his hair into a Rogue-hawk. The story is an intriguing three-parter (with gorgeous Chris Weston art) whereby Fr1day actually loses a fight and ends up in the OR. 
<br /><small><em>Fr1day's back in '95...</em></small></p>


<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/g47vAZwSD0k" target="_blank">Bradley</a>: Master Of Martial Arts</strong><br />
The Karate Kid, but with Bradley and dominoes.
<br /><small><em>Bradley ends his run in the 1995 Yearbook with <strong>Bradley & the Baby Sitter</strong>.</em></small></p>


<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/sPkWwlZ56GQ" target="_blank">Nemesis</a>: Hammer of Warlocks</strong><br />
This is the history of Nemesis in three parts. Otherwise, it serves only as a precurser to a new book slated to begin in 1995...
<br /><small><em>...which doesn't get published until 1999...</em></small></p>
