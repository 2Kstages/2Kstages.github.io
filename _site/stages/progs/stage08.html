		<h2>Stage 08 - Mooreland</h2>
<h3>Progs 308-334: 1983</h3>

<hr class="splitter" />

<p>Alan Moore had been active in the prog for a while now, turning out consistently entertaining short thrills in the form of Robo-Tales, Future Shocks and Time Twisters.  Abelard Snazz demonstrated that he couldn't quite be contained within the strictures of those mediums, and here we get to see his first long-form thrill in Skizz even as he continues to dominate the Time Twisters.</p>

<p>Dredd, Rogue & Slade take up the other main slots in the prog as we head towards the prog 335 pure jump-on.  Just before we get there, though, prog 330 steals the limelight (by smashing it apart with an axe) as Slaine launches himself ferociously into the fray.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/27bRs1r_k8I" target="_blank">Skizz</a></strong> *NEW THRILL*<br />
Altogether now: it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" target="_blank">E.T.</a> meets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_from_the_Blackstuff" target="_blank">The Boys from the Black Stuff</a>.  Perhaps the first 2000 AD strip with a female lead in Roxy O'Rourke.
<br /><small><em>There's a second series (Skizz II: Alien Cultures) in '92, but it's not by Moore and so perhaps can be considered non-canon. It certainly stretches the format, and there's no cliffhanger in this first series that needs answered.</em></small></p>

<p><strong>Tharg's Time Twisters</strong><br /> 
Alan Moore provides over half of the Twisters in this stage.  Of key importance is prog 317's DR & Quinch Have Fun On Earth, as it once again demonstrates Moore's ability to create characters that break free of their restrictions and go on to greater things.  We'll see them in their own series soon.
<br /><small><em>These do return in the next stage, but at a much reduced rate as they share space again with the Future Shocks.</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/ktW-dcoj3y0" target="_blank">Judge Dredd</a></strong><br />
This stage proves that you don't need epics: there's scope for great medium-length thrills in Dredd. Up to now, the average length of a Dredd story has been three episodes (and that's including epics), so the 8-part Destiny's Angels in the previous stage, and here the 6-part The Starborn Thing and 7-part Cry of the Werewolf are a new direction (plus they're all first-rate stories).
<br /><small><em>Medium-length Dredd's continue in the next stage as dusk falls...</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/CWFjnOYW6_Y" target="_blank">Tharg the Mighty</a>: Invasion Of The Thrill-Snatchers</strong><br />
Alien editor deals with various assaults on thrill power.
<br /><small><em>More in the next stage....</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Ry8KKQXkmb8" target="_blank">Rogue Trooper</a></strong><br />
Fort Neuro comes to an end and Eye of the Traitor moves the central plot forward.
<br /><small><em>The Rogue residency continues unabated in the next stage...</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/U3m6wLFbT3w" target="_blank">Robo-Hunter</a> [in Brit-Cit]</strong>
After a short-break, we get the 19-episode The Slaying of Slade (which is more gritty and less comedic than earlier Brit-Cit adventures), followed by the 4-part coda of Sam Slade's Last Case.
<br /><small><em>Slade is coaxed out of retirement in 1985's Farewell, My Billions (435-443).</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Sebs-wIEZlQ" target="_blank">Tharg's Future Shocks</a></strong><br />
Usually one-off tales with a twist.
<br /><small><em>More in the next stage...</em></small></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/W64HGS638mQ" target="_blank">Slaine</a></strong> *NEW THRILL*<br />
It's a celtic Conan, as Slaine and his literal sidekick Ukko roam Tir Nan Og (a mythic Britain) in search of riches and redemption. Slaine ends up smiting all who stand against him, but doesn't ever think it's too many.  Here we get the introductory The Time-Monster (where Pat Mills can't resist including a T-Rex, but at least it's not a relative of Old One Eye) and The Beast in the Broch. 
<br /><small><em>Slaine chops his way through into the next stage...</em></small></p>
