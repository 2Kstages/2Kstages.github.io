<h2>The A.B.C. Warriors</h2>

<p>Seven military-grade robots deliver justice for those who can't defend themselves from the predations of corporate fascism.</p>
<p>As part of the complex Millsverse, the original series was a spin-off from Ro-Busters and first resurfaced as a crossover with <a href="../Nemesis/books.html">Nemesis the Warlock</a>. Prototype versions of the Warriors show up in <a href="../Savage/data.html">Savage</a>, which also has strong crossover links with <a href="../RoBusters/data.html">Ro-Busters</a>. Millsverse cross-pollination is not necessarily linear!</p>
<p>Who makes up the seven is often in flux, with a variety of line-ups over the years as some are killed off, some resurrected - and loyalty is never guaranteed.</p>
<p>Spread the word!</p>
