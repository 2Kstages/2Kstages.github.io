<p>Basketball meets <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073631/" target="_blank">Rollerball</a> (minus motorbikes, plus jetpacks). Despite having no other obvious narrative link, this story does take place in the Dreddverse, as the team captain (John 'Giant' Clay) is the father of <a href="../Judge/GiantSnr.html#baseMenu">Judge Giant (senior)</a>: a compatriot of Dredds who was murdered by <a href="../OrlokTheAssassin/data.html">Orlok</a> during the <a href="../JudgeDredd/1981.html#baseMenu">Block Mania</a> crisis. Before his murder, he had fathered a son, who is the <a href="../Judge/GiantJnr.html#baseMenu">Judge Giant (junior)</a> currently featuring in many Dredd stories. The sequel (<a href="../Inferno/data.html">Inferno</a>) simply adds back in the motorbikes, realizing its earlier mistake.</p>
<p>The 1990's soft reboot (set slightly in the future from the original but with no shared characters) throws up a gang of easily identifiable (but attractive) misfits (leader, vixen, driver, tough & hacker) that are forced into service as mercenaries by a shadowy government organization, and then betrayed. Also, they have jetpacks (which very rarely get used in a sport setting). Nobody ever changes their clothes, so if this was presented in smell-o-vision, you wouldn't like it.</p>
<p>The stories starting in 2022 feel like a hard reboot designed to appeal to a younger audience (just like Scrappy Doo), but say they're set in a Dredd-contemporary Mega-City One.</p>
