<h2>Harlem Heroes</h2>

<p>Basketball meets <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073631/" target="_blank">Rollerball</a> (minus motorbikes, plus jetpacks). Despite having no other obvious narrative link, this story does take place in the Dreddverse, as the team captain (John 'Giant' Clay) is the father of Judge Giant (senior): a compatriot of Dredds who was murdered by Orlok during the <a href="../JudgeDredd/1981.html">Block Mania</a> crisis. Before his murder, he had fathered a son, who is the Judge Giant (junior) currently featuring in many Dredd stories. The sequel (Inferno) simply adds back in the motorbikes, realizing its earlier mistake.</p>
<p>The 1990's soft reboot (set slightly in the future from the original but with no shared characters) throws up a gang of easily identifiable (but attractive) misfits (leader, vixen, driver, tough & hacker) that are forced into service as mercenaries by a shadowy government organization, and then betrayed. Also, they have jetpacks (which very rarely get used in a sport setting). Nobody ever changes their clothes, so if this was presented in smell-o-vision, you wouldn't like it.</p>
